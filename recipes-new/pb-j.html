    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What's more American than a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? A staple of school lunches, this sandwich is simple and delicious.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Peanut butter, amount to your liking (I pile it on)</li>
            <li>Jam or jelly of your choice, amount to your liking (I prefer grape or raspberry, and lots of it)</li>
            <li>Two slices of bread of your choice</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread peanut butter on one slice of bread. If you will be saving the sandwich for later, spreading the peanut butter on both slices of bread can prevent the sandwich from sliding apart.</li>
            <li>Spread the jam or jelly on the other slice of bread. Put the slices together.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
